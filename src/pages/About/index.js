      <p>Learn more about Ink N Threadworks. Ink'n Thread Works, established in 1992 by Roger Smith and Ernie Szabo, began by serving Magyar Marketing, a Hungarian mail-order company, and later expanded to the World Market, catering to over 100 nationalities. For the past 30+ years, this family-run business has prioritized outstanding customer service, aiming for 100% client satisfaction.

Ink'n Thread Works offers a comprehensive range of advertising solutions, including embroidery, silkscreening, signs, banners, vinyl graphics, and advertising specialty items like business cards, mugs, pens, and can coozies. They handle orders of all sizes, from single items to large-scale productions, with a commitment to quality, value, and efficiency. Their art department can replicate existing logos or create custom designs, ensuring client approval before printing.

The business prides itself on competitive pricing and a commitment to customer satisfaction, promising to beat any competitor's price. They have a proven track record, having successfully printed for major American companies while maintaining personalized service for smaller clients.

In September 2024, Amelia Karousis will officially merge into the business after six months of collaboration with Roger. Amelia brings ten years of experience in vinyl cutting and sublimation, as well as years of business administration expertise. Prior to this, she was a professional photographer. This addition strengthens Ink'n Thread Works' capabilities and expands their service offerings.</p>
